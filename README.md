# Getting Started with Sickle Cell Anemia Management App

This project aims to create a comprehensive tool for individuals with sickle cell anemia, empowering them to effectively manage their health. Sickle cell anemia is a genetic blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, resulting in rigid, sickle-shaped red blood cells that can obstruct blood vessels, leading to pain, fatigue, and organ damage. Managing this condition presents significant challenges due to the unpredictable nature of pain crises, which can occur at any time and in any location.

## Problem Statement

Managing health effectively is challenging for individuals with sickle cell anemia. Existing health management apps lack specificity for this condition, hindering symptom tracking, medication adherence, and crisis prediction. Additionally, daily life hurdles, such as maintaining regular activities and strained interpersonal relationships, further complicate management.

## Solution Statement

The Sickle Cell Anemia Management App seeks to address these challenges by providing a personalized assistant for individuals with sickle cell anemia. Key features include:

Symptom Tracking: Log and track symptoms to monitor health status.
Medication Adherence: Receive reminders and track medication intake for consistency.
